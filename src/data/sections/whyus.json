    "title": "Why Us ?",
    "paragraph1": "As a team, we are not just defined by our roles. We are a crew of thinkers, dreamers, and innovators. The moment a client connects with us, we own them, and take their business as our own. Our motto is simple, we find that special connection with our clients that makes us go above and beyond for them.   ",
    "paragraph2": "Once you reach out to us, we will assign you a project manager right away. You will be hearing from our project manager within 12 hours who will talk to you, understand your requirements, and build that special connection from the first conversation.   Once your concept is understood by us, well suggest some ideas powered by our expertise and experience and a final layout will be prepared.   ",
    "paragraph3": " Depending upon the work, the finest team(consisting of a web designer, developers, content writer, SEO specialist, 2D/3D animator, graphic designer, and digital marketer) will be assigned to you right away. We connect each of our team members to the client through email or messaging platforms like Slack so that there is a communication barrier that may arise otherwise. ",
    "paragraph4": "YES! Our clients have access to our team members directly, and we encourage our clients to get in touch with the team as well along with the project manager, so that each team member knows what exactly our client wants and the client knows what the team is up to. This helps us get the most accurate results timely and effective.    ",
    "paragraph5": "Our personalized approach will never allow us to settle for mediocrity. We aim to take our clients to the topmost level. We have formulated this 1-to-8 rule which states that with every dollar you spend on digital marketing, you get $8 back as revenue. Curious about this rule? Reach out to us and we will assign you a team within 12 hours.       "
